# A Computer Science Study from the JavaScript Perspective
If you stumble upon this repo, I hope it'll be helpful in your Computer Science and JavaScript learning journey. It's designed like flash cards. This project contains exercises and examples using Computer Science structures starting with a few examples of JavaScript however, the intent is to focus on Computer Science structures. 

## Why JavaScript?
JavaScript is the vehicle. These computer science structures translate to other coding languages. It's unlikely you'll find many npm packages here.

## Lifelong Learning
Some believe intelligence is gifted to a divine few. Others work really hard to gain, retain and recall it. 

## A Collection of Learning Gems 
Approach coding like a gym workout

### Feynman Technique Summary
* Don’t fool yourself that you know something
* Explain it to someone else in simple language. ( My mate Karrel - A children’s soft toy)
* Identify areas you are having problems explaining. Go back to the source. Work through examples until you understand
* Explain in simple jargon free language to identify your base assumptions

### Other Gems (Sources unknown)
* Focus your effort on the stuff you don’t know
* Practice examples and practice recall. Don’t go straight to the answers
* Use flash cards
* Don’t beat yourself up about making mistakes, there are enough people out there to do that for you :-)
* Long term recall is formed with spaced repetition
* Note taking is often a false sense of security. You can fool yourself you know a subject with copious note taking
* Recall is where it’s at. Do the examples from recall
* Nobody said getting into elite physical condition would be easy. If it was, everyone would do it
* When you feel like giving up, remember anything worth doing may suck in the beginning. 
* At the point of giving up you might be closest to success. When giving up,  make it's wise to make sure the decsion based on information.
