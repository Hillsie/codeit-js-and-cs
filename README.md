# A Computer Science Study from the JavaScript Perspective
If you stumble upon this repo, I hope it'll be helpful in your Computer Science and JavaScript learning journey. It's designed like flash cards. This project contains exercises and examples using Computer Science structures starting with a review of JavaScript. The goal is to dive in with sufficient explanation.

## Why JavaScript?
JavaScript is the vehicle. These computer science structures should translate to other coding languages. It's unlikely you'll find many npm packages here.
One aspect is understanding the language. The other is understading how to apply it. Knowing JavaScript can lead into ReactJS and NodeJS.

## Lifelong Learning
Some believe intelligence is gifted to a divine few. Others work really hard to gain, retain and recall it. 

## A Collection of Learning Gems 
Approach coding like a gym workout

### Feynman Technique Summary
* Don’t fool yourself that you know something
* Explain it to someone else in simple language. ( My mate Karrel - A children’s soft toy)
* Identify areas you are having problems explaining. Go back to the source. Work through examples until you understand
* Explain in simple jargon free language to identify your base assumptions

### Other Gems (Sources unknown)
* Focus your efforts on the stuff you don’t know
* Practice examples and practice recall. Don’t go straight to the answers
* Use flash cards
* Don’t beat yourself up about making mistakes
* Long term recall is formed with spaced repetition
* Note taking is often a false sense of security, fooling yourself you know a subject
* Recall is where it’s at. Do the examples
* Nobody said that get yourself into good condition would be easy
* Anything worth doing may suck in the beginning. Attitude may mean it doesn’t.
