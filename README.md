# A JavaScript Study
Revision resource with examples.

## Lifelong Learning
The purpose is for revision and recall and reference for when I forget. I'm human.

### Some learning gems I've picked up along the way

### Feynman Technique Summary
* Don’t fool yourself that you know something. I try leave the ego at the door, especially when learning.
* Explain it to someone else in simple language. ( My mate Karrel and a line of rubber ducks on the monitor)
* Identify areas you are having problems explaining. Go back to the source. Work through examples until you understand
* Explain in simple jargon free language to identify your base assumptions

### Other Gems (Sources unknown)
* Focus effort on the stuff I don’t know
* Practice examples and practice recall. Don’t go straight to the answers
* Use flash cards for revision
* Don’t beat yourself up about making mistakes, there are enough people out there to do that for you :-)
* Long term recall is formed with spaced repetition
* Note taking is often a false sense of security. You can fool yourself you know a subject with copious notes
* Recall is where it’s at. Do the examples from recall
* Nobody said getting into physical condition would be easy. If it was, everyone would do it
* When you feel like giving up, remember anything worth doing may suck in the beginning. 
* At the point of giving up you might be closest to your success. 
* When giving up,  make it's wise to make sure the decsion based on real information.
