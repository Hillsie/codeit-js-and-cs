How can we explain the efficiency of a program
... If you are reading thig. Note to you. I'm going into the dark a bit as I need to prepare for an interivew... might be a while before I have time for this. About a month ...

<details><summary>Why is simply measuring a program with timmers not a suitable way of understanding it's efficiency?</summary>
<p>

#### There are too many variables impacting the understanding
The objective is to  measure the runtime between algorithms. If there are to many variables, it's difficult to isolate the algorithm to compare behaviour.
Variables

* between implementations
* between computers
* between imputs
